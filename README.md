This will be populated, slowly, over time. Just like a delicious & scrumptious casserole! Yum yum can't wait to hear more about those casseroles.

## Executive Summary
Casseroles are a cornerstone of American cooking, but what is a casserole? Definitions vary wildly and the only thing that’s widely agreed upon is a baking element. This project aims to showcase how people make casseroles, how they are perceived by the public, and pit various ingredients and flavors against each other. Casserole recipes will be scraped from Allrecipes.com and/or food.com, cleaned via python, and showcased in Tableau. I am concerned with scraping data, as we haven’t touched on it in class yet, but I’m confident that it can be done!

## Motivation
I have a fascination with the 1950’s-80’s cookbooks you see at thrift store. Casserole’s are more or less a product of those times and some of the recipes I’ve found for them are truly unhinged. 

## Data Question

Most popular protein (beans, beef, fish, etc.)
Baking dish size/shape
Baking time/temperature
Ingredients list/count 
Is salt/pepper listed as an ingredient? (aka bland casseroles)
Recipe ratings on average
Finding most common and most uncommon ingredients

I have no articles on this that I’ve found, but I have found some github repos of people who have built scrapers for allrecipes. I have not tested or seen the output of these, but I believe I can find sufficient help in this task. The Hhursev scraper is excellent and should be perfectly viable for this project!

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
My MVP would be a Tableau dashboard where you can cycle through ingredients and/or baking dish sizes to showcase the variety and statistics of casseroles. I plan on having a large interactive element to my dashboard with plenty of ways to navigate between pages and have a fun, humorous tone to the whole thing. The intended audience is anyone who has ever had a grandparent cook for them.

### Data Sources
Allrecipes.com, food.com, bettycrocker.com, and a few of the other, larger websites listed here on hhursev’s data scraper. I think grouping each of these by website could be interesting. 
#### Known Issues and Challenges
I believe cleaning the scraped data will be very difficult, but I don’t believe I need an API for it. I have found some resources for aiding in the scraping of data, so I hope those are helpful! I also plan on throwing up due to many of the recipes I will find.
